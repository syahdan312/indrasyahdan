Function Declarations
Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions are declared with the following syntax:

function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}
Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

Example
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
