JavaScript Integer Accuracy
JavaScript integers are only accurate up to 15 digits:

Integer Precision
let x = 999999999999999;
let y = 9999999999999999;
In JavaScript, all numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754 standard).

With this standard, large integer cannot be exactly represented and will be rounded.

Because of this, JavaScript can only safely represent integers:

Up to 9007199254740991 +(253-1)

and

Down to -9007199254740991 -(253-1).

Integer values outside this range lose precision.

How to Create a BigInt
To create a BigInt, append n to the end of an integer or call BigInt():

Examples
let x = 9999999999999999;
let y = 9999999999999999n;
