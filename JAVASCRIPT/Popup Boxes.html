Alert Box
An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.

Syntax
window.alert("sometext");
The window.alert() method can be written without the window prefix.

Example
alert("I am an alert box!");
