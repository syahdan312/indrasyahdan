JavaScript Asynchronous Iteration
ECMAScript 2018 added asynchronous iterators and iterables.

With asynchronous iterables, we can use the await keyword in for/of loops.

Example
for await () {}
JavaScript asynchronous iteration is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

JavaScript Promise.finally
ECMAScript 2018 finalizes the full implementation of the Promise object with Promise.finally:

Example
let myPromise = new Promise();

myPromise.then();
myPromise.catch();
myPromise.finally();
Promise.finally is supported in all modern browsers since November 2018:

JavaScript Array Rest Elements
ECMAScript 2018 added the rest operator (...).

The rest operator (...) allows us to destruct an array and collect the leftovers:


Example 1
let a, rest;
const arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];

[a, ...rest] = arr1;
Example 2
let a, b, rest;
const arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];

[a, b, ...rest] = arr1;
JavaScript Object Rest Properties
ECMAScript 2018 added the rest operator (...).

This allows us to destruct an object and collect the leftovers onto a new object:

Example
// Create an Object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Destructure the Object
let {type, model, color} = car;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The car type is: " + type;
Object rest properties is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

New JavaScript RegExp Features
ECMAScript 2018 added 4 new RegExp features:

Unicode Property Escapes (\p{...})
Lookbehind Assertions (?<= ) and (?<! )
Named Capture Groups

The new RegExp features is supported in all modern browsers since June 2020:

JavaScript Threads
In JavaScript you use the Web Workers API to create threads.

Worker threads are used to execute code in the background so that the main program can continue execution.

Worker threads run simultaneously with the main program. Simultaneous execution of different parts of a program can be time-saving.

JavaScript Shared Memory
Shared memory is a feature that allows threads (different parts of a program) to access and update the same data in the same memory.

Instead of passing data between threads, you can pass a SharedArrayBuffer object that points to the memory where data is saved.

SharedArrayBuffer
A SharedArrayBuffer object represents a fixed-length raw binary data buffer similar to the ArrayBuffer object.
