JavaScript Array findLast() Method
ES2023 added the findLast() method that will start from the end of an array and return the value of the first element that satisfies a condition.

Example
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let high = temp.findLast(x => x > 40);
JavaScript Array findLastIndex() Method
The findLastIndex() method finds the index of the last element that satisfies a condition.

Example
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let pos = temp.findLastIndex(x => x > 40);
JavaScript Array toReversed() Method
ES2023 added the Array toReversed() method as a safe way to reverse an array without altering the original array.

The difference between the new toReversed() method and the old reverse() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

Example
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const reversed = months.toReversed();
JavaScript Array toSorted() Method
ES2023 added the Array toSorted() method as a safe way to sort an array without altering the original array.

The difference between the new toSorted() method and the old sort() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

Example
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const sorted = months.toSorted();
JavaScript Array toSpliced() Method
ES2023 added the Array toSpliced() method as a safe way to splice an array without altering the original array.

The difference between the new toSpliced() method and the old splice() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

Example
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const spliced = months.toSpliced(0, 1);
