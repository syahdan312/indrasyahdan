The For In Loop
The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:

Syntax
for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Example
const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}
JavaScript Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Often this is the case when working with arrays:

Instead of writing:
text += cars[0] + "<br>";
text += cars[1] + "<br>";
text += cars[2] + "<br>";
text += cars[3] + "<br>";
text += cars[4] + "<br>";
text += cars[5] + "<br>";
You can write:
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
Looping over an Array
Example
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}
