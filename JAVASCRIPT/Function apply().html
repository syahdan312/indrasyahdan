The JavaScript apply() Method
The apply() method is similar to the call() method (previous chapter).

In this example the fullName method of person is applied on person1:

Example
const person = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

const person1 = {
  firstName: "Mary",
  lastName: "Doe"
}

// This will return "Mary Doe":
person.fullName.apply(person1);
Function Borrowing
With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

The example below creates 2 objects (person and member).

The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object:

Example
const person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

const member = {
  firstName:"Hege",
  lastName: "Nilsen",
}

let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
All Functions are Methods
In JavaScript all functions are object methods.

If a function is not a method of a JavaScript object, it is a function of the global object (see previous chapter).

The example below creates an object with 3 properties, firstName, lastName, fullName.

Example
const person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

// This will return "John Doe":
person.fullName();  
Function Declarations
Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions are declared with the following syntax:

function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}
Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

Example
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
Invoking a Function as a Function
Example
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
myFunction(10, 2);           // Will return 20

Function Parameters and Arguments
Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions can have parameters:

function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
