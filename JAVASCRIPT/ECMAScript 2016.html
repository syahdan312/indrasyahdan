Exponentiation Operator
The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

Example
let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2;
x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x, y):

Example
let x = 5;
let z = Math.pow(x,2);
Exponentiation Assignment
The exponentiation assignment operator (**=) raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.
Example
let x = 5;
x **= 2;

JavaScript Array includes()
ECMAScript 2016 introduced Array.includes to arrays.

This allows us to check if an element is present in an array:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

fruits.includes("Mango");

JavaScript String Padding
ECMAScript 2017 added two string methods to JavaScript: padStart() and padEnd() to support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string.

Examples
let text = "5";
text = text.padStart(4,0);
let text = "5";
text = text.padEnd(4,0);
JavaScript Object Entries
ECMAScript 2017 added the Object.entries() method to objects.

Object.entries() returns an array of the key/value pairs in an object:

Example
const person = {
  firstName : "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  age : 50,
  eyeColor : "blue"
};

let text = Object.entries(person);
Object.entries() makes it simple to use objects in loops:

Example
const fruits = {Bananas:300, Oranges:200, Apples:500};

let text = "";
for (let [fruit, value] of Object.entries(fruits)) {
  text += fruit + ": " + value + "<br>";
}
Object.entries() also makes it simple to convert objects to maps:

Example
const fruits = {Bananas:300, Oranges:200, Apples:500};

const myMap = new Map(Object.entries(fruits));
JavaScript Object Values
Object.values() is similar to Object.entries(), but returns a single dimension array of the object values:

Example
const person = {
  firstName : "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  age : 50,
  eyeColor : "blue"
};

let text = Object.values(person);

JavaScript Async Functions
Waiting for a Timeout
async function myDisplay() {
  let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
    setTimeout(function() { myResolve("I love You !!"); }, 3000);
  });
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = await myPromise;
}

myDisplay();

JavaScript Trailing Commas
JavaScript allows trailing commas wherever a comma-separated list of values is accepted.

In Array and Object Literals, Function Calls, Parameters, Imports and Exports.

Example
function myFunc(x,,,) {};
const myArr = [1,2,3,4,,,];
const myObj = {fname: John, age:50,,,};

JavaScript Asynchronous Iteration
ECMAScript 2018 added asynchronous iterators and iterables.

With asynchronous iterables, we can use the await keyword in for/of loops.

Example
for await () {}
JavaScript asynchronous iteration is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Chrome 63	Edge 79	Firefox 57	Safari 11	Opera 50
Dec 2017	Jan 2020	Nov 2017	Sep 2017	Jan 2018
JavaScript Promise.finally
ECMAScript 2018 finalizes the full implementation of the Promise object with Promise.finally:

Example
let myPromise = new Promise();

myPromise.then();
myPromise.catch();
myPromise.finally();
Promise.finally is supported in all modern browsers since November 2018:

Chrome 63	Edge 18	Firefox 58	Safari 11.1	Opera 50
Dec 2017	Nov 2018	Jan 2018	Mar 2018	Jan 2018

JavaScript Array Rest Elements
ECMAScript 2018 added the rest operator (...).

The rest operator (...) allows us to destruct an array and collect the leftovers:


Example 1
let a, rest;
const arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];

[a, ...rest] = arr1;
Example 2
let a, b, rest;
const arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];

[a, b, ...rest] = arr1;
JavaScript Object Rest Properties
ECMAScript 2018 added the rest operator (...).

This allows us to destruct an object and collect the leftovers onto a new object:

Example
// Create an Object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Destructure the Object
let {type, model, color} = car;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The car type is: " + type;
Object rest properties is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Jul 2017	Jan 2020	Aug 2017	Mar 2018	Aug 2017
New JavaScript RegExp Features
ECMAScript 2018 added 4 new RegExp features:

Unicode Property Escapes (\p{...})
Lookbehind Assertions (?<= ) and (?<! )
Named Capture Groups
s (dotAll) Flag
The new RegExp features is supported in all modern browsers since June 2020:

Chrome 64	Edge 79	Firefox 78	Safari 12	Opera 51
Jan 2018	Jan 2020	Jun 2020	Sep 2018	Feb 2018
JavaScript Threads
In JavaScript you use the Web Workers API to create threads.

Worker threads are used to execute code in the background so that the main program can continue execution.

Worker threads run simultaneously with the main program. Simultaneous execution of different parts of a program can be time-saving.

JavaScript Shared Memory
Shared memory is a feature that allows threads (different parts of a program) to access and update the same data in the same memory.

Instead of passing data between threads, you can pass a SharedArrayBuffer object that points to the memory where data is saved.

SharedArrayBuffer
A SharedArrayBuffer object represents a fixed-length raw binary data buffer similar to the ArrayBuffer object.

JavaScript String trimStart()
ES2019 added the String method trimStart() to JavaScript.

The trimStart() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the start of a string.

Example
let text1 = "     Hello World!     ";
let text2 = text1.trimStart();
JavaScript String trimStart() is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Chrome 66	Edge 79	Firefox 61	Safari 12	Opera 50
Apr 2018	Jan 2020	Jun 2018	Sep 2018	May 2018
JavaScript String trimEnd()
ES2019 added the String method trimEnd() to JavaScript.

The trimEnd() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the end of a string.

Example
let text1 = "     Hello World!     ";
let text2 = text1.trimEnd();
JavaScript String trimEnd() is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Chrome 66	Edge 79	Firefox 61	Safari 12	Opera 50
Apr 2018	Jan 2020	Jun 2018	Sep 2018	May 2018
JavaScript Object fromEntries()
ES2019 added the Object method fromEntries() to JavaScript.

The fromEntries() method creates an object from iterable key / value pairs.

Example
const fruits = [
["apples", 300],
["pears", 900],
["bananas", 500]
];

const myObj = Object.fromEntries(fruits);
JavaScript Object fromEntries() is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Chrome 73	Edge 79	Firefox 63	Safari 12.1	Opera 60

Optional catch Binding
From ES2019 you can omit the catch parameter if you don't need it:.

Example
Before 2019:

try {
// code
} catch (err) {
// code
}
After 2019:

try {
// code
} catch {
// code
}
Optional catch binding is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Chrome 66	Edge 79	Firefox 58	Safari 11.1	Opera 53
Apr 2018	Jan 2020	Jan 2018	Mar 2018	May 2018
JavaScript Array flat()
ES2019 added the Array flat() method to JavaScript.

The flat() method creates a new array by flattening a nested array.

Example
const myArr = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]];
const newArr = myArr.flat();
JavaScript Array flat() is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Chrome 69	Edge 79	Firefox 62	Safari 12	Opera 56
Sep 2018	Jan 2020	Sep 2018	Sep 2018	Sep 2018
JavaScript Array flatMap()
ES2019 added the Array flatMap() method to JavaScript.

The flatMap() method first maps all elements of an array and then creates a new array by flattening the array.

Example
const myArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const newArr = myArr.flatMap(x => [x, x * 10]);
Stable Array sort()
ES2019 revised the Array sort() method.

Before 2019, the specification allowed unstable sorting algorithms such as QuickSort.

After ES2019, browsers must use a stable sorting algorithm:

When sorting elements on a value, the elements must keep their relative position to other elements with the same value.

Example
const myArr = [
  {name:"X00",price:100 },
  {name:"X01",price:100 },
  {name:"X02",price:100 },
  {name:"X03",price:100 },
  {name:"X04",price:110 },
  {name:"X05",price:110 },
  {name:"X06",price:110 },
  {name:"X07",price:110 }
];
In the example above, when sorting on price, the result should not have names in a different relative position, such as this:

X01 100
X03 100
X00 100
X03 100
X05 110
X04 110
X06 110
X07 110
Revised JSON.stringify()
ES2019 revised the JSON stringify() method.

Before 2019, JSON could not stringify character encoded with \.

Example
let text = JSON.stringify("\u26D4");
Before ES2019, using JSON.stringify()JSON on UTF-8 code points (U+D800 to U+DFFF) returned broken Unicode characters like ���.

After this revision, strings with UTF-8 code points convert safely with JSON.stringify(), and back to the original using JSON.parse().

Separator Symbols
Line separators and paragraph separator symbols (\u2028 and \u2029) are now allowed in string literals.

Before 2019, these were treated as line terminators and resulted in error exceptions:

Example
// This is valid in ES2019:
let text = "\u2028";
Note
Now, JavaScript and JSON have equal rules.

Before ES2019:

text = JSON.parse('"\u2028"') would parse to ''.

text = '"\u2028"' would give syntax error.

Revised Function toString()
ES2019 revised the Function toString() method.

The toString() method returns a string representing the source code of a function.

From 2019, toString() must return the source code of the function including comments, spaces, and syntax details.

Before 2019, different browsers returned different variants of the function (like without comments and spaces). From 2019 the function should be returned exactly as it is written.

Example
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}

JavaScript BigInt
JavaScript BigInt variables are used to store big integer values that are too big to be represented by a a normal JavaScript Number.

JavaScript integers are only accurate up to about 15 digits.

Integer Example
let x = 999999999999999;
let y = 9999999999999999; // too big
BigInt Example
let x = 9999999999999999;
let y = 9999999999999999n;
To create a BigInt, append n to the end of an integer or call BigInt():

Example
let x = 1234567890123456789012345n;
let y = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345)
The JavaScript typeof a BigInt is "bigint":

Example
let x = BigInt(999999999999999);
let type = typeof x;
BigInt is supported in all modern browsers since September 2020:

Chrome 67	Edge 79	Firefox 68	Safari 14	Opera 54
May 2018	Jan 2020	Jul 2019	Sep 2020	Jun 2018
JavaScript String matchAll()
Before ES2020 there was no string method that could be used to search for all occurrences of a string in a string.

Example
const iterator = text.matchAll("Cats");
If the parameter is a regular expression, the global flag (g) must be set set, otherwise a TypeError is thrown.

Example
const iterator = text.matchAll(/Cats/g);
If you want to search case insensitive, the insensitive flag (i) must be set:

Example
const iterator = text.matchAll(/Cats/gi);
Note
ES2021 introduced the string method replaceAll().

The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
The ?? operator returns the first argument if it is not nullish (null or undefined).

Otherwise it returns the second.

Example
let name = null;
let text = "missing";
let result = name ?? text;
The nullish operator is supported in all modern browsers since March 2020:

Chrome 80	Edge 80	Firefox 72	Safari 13.1	Opera 67
Feb 2020	Feb 2020	Jan 2020	Mar 2020	Mar 2020
The Optional Chaining Operator (?.)
The Optional Chaining Operator returns undefined if an object is undefined or null (instead of throwing an error).

Example
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
let name = car?.name;
The ?.= operator is supported in all modern browsers since March 2020:

JavaScript String ReplaceAll()
ES2021 introduced the string method replaceAll():

Example
text = text.replaceAll("Cats","Dogs");
text = text.replaceAll("cats","dogs");
The replaceAll() method allows you to specify a regular expression instead of a string to be replaced.

If the parameter is a regular expression, the global flag (g) must be set, otherwise a TypeError is thrown.

Example
text = text.replaceAll(/Cats/g,"Dogs");
text = text.replaceAll(/cats/g,"dogs");
replace.All() is supported in all modern browsers since April 2021:

Chrome 85	Edge 85	Firefox 77	Safari 13.1	Opera 71

JavaScript Numeric Separator (_)
ES2021 intoduced the numeric separator (_) to make numbers more readable:

Example
const num = 1_000_000_000;
The numeric separator is only for visual use.

Example
const num1 = 1_000_000_000;
const num2 = 1000000000;
(num1 === num2);
The numeric separator can be placed anywhere in a number:

Example
const num1 = 1_2_3_4_5;
Note
The numeric separator is not allowed at the beginning or at the end of a number.

In JavaScript only variables can start with _.

The numeric separator is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:

Jun 2019	Jan 2020	Oct 2019	Sep 2019	Jun 2019

JavaScript Array at()
ES2022 intoduced the array method at():

Examples
Get the third element of fruits:

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits.at(2);
Get the third element of fruits:

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits[2];
The at() method returns an indexed element from an array.

The at() method returns the same as [].

The at() method is supported in all modern browsers since March 2022:

Chrome 92	Edge 92	Firefox 90	Safari 15.4	Opera 78
Apr 2021	Jul 2021	Jul 2021	Mar 2022	Aug 2021
Note
Many languages allows negative bracket indexing like [-1] to access elements from the end of an object / array / string.

This is not possible in JavaScript, because [] is used for accessing both arrays and objects. obj[-1] refers to the value of key -1, not to the last property of the object.

The at() method was introduced in ES2022 to solve this problem.

JavaScript String at()
ES2022 intoduced the string method at():

Examples
Get the third letter of name:

const name = "W3Schools";
let letter = name.at(2);
Get the third letter of name:

const name = "W3Schools";
let letter = name[2];
The at() method returns an indexed element from an string.

The at() method returns the same as [].

The at() method is supported in all modern browsers since March 2022:

Apr 2021	Jul 2021	Jul 2021	Mar 2022	Aug 2021
RegExp d Modifier
ES2022 added the /d modifier to express the start and end of the match.

Example
let text = "aaaabb";
let result = text.match(/(aa)(bb)/d);
RegExp Modifiers are used to spescfy case-insensitive, and other global searches:

Modifier	Description	Try it
i	Perform case-insensitive matching	
g	Perform a global match (find all)	
m	Perform multiline matching	
d	Perform substring matches (New in ES2022)	
Object hasOwn
ES2022 provides a safe way to check if a property is the own property of an object.

Object.hasOwn() is similar to Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty but supports all object types.

Example
Object.hasOwn(myObject, age)
Error Cause
ES2022 let you specify the reason behind an error with error.cause.

Example
try { connectData(); } catch (err) { throw new Error("Connecting failed.", { cause: err }); }

JavaScript Array findLast() Method
ES2023 added the findLast() method that will start from the end of an array and return the value of the first element that satisfies a condition.

Example
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let high = temp.findLast(x => x > 40);
JavaScript Array findLastIndex() Method
The findLastIndex() method finds the index of the last element that satisfies a condition.

Example
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let pos = temp.findLastIndex(x => x > 40);
JavaScript Array toReversed() Method
ES2023 added the Array toReversed() method as a safe way to reverse an array without altering the original array.

The difference between the new toReversed() method and the old reverse() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

Example
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const reversed = months.toReversed();
JavaScript Array toSorted() Method
ES2023 added the Array toSorted() method as a safe way to sort an array without altering the original array.

The difference between the new toSorted() method and the old sort() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

Example
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const sorted = months.toSorted();
JavaScript Array toSpliced() Method
ES2023 added the Array toSpliced() method as a safe way to splice an array without altering the original array.

The difference between the new toSpliced() method and the old splice() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

Example
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const spliced = months.toSpliced(0, 1);

JavaScript Object.groupBy()
Example
// Create an Array
const fruits = [
  {name:"apples", quantity:300},
  {name:"bananas", quantity:500},
  {name:"oranges", quantity:200},
  {name:"kiwi", quantity:150}
];

// Callback function to Group Elements
function myCallback({ quantity }) {
  return quantity > 200 ? "ok" : "low";
}

// Group by Quantity
const result = Object.groupBy(fruits, myCallback);
Description
The Object.groupBy() method groups elements of an object according to string values returned from a callback function.

The Object.groupBy() method does not change the original object.

Note:
The elements in the original and in the returned object are the same.

Changes will be reflected in both the original and in the returned object.

JavaScript Map.groupBy()
Example
// Create an Array
const fruits = [
  {name:"apples", quantity:300},
  {name:"bananas", quantity:500},
  {name:"oranges", quantity:200},
  {name:"kiwi", quantity:150}
];

// Callback function to Group Elements
function myCallback({ quantity }) {
  return quantity > 200 ? "ok" : "low";
}

// Group by Quantity
const result = Map.groupBy(fruits, myCallback);
Description
The Map.groupBy() method groups elements of an object according to string values returned from a callback function.

The Map.groupBy() method does not change the original object.

Note:
The elements in the original and in the returned object are the same.

Changes will be reflected in both the original and in the returned object.

Object.groupBy() vs Map.groupBy()
The difference between Object.groupBy() and Map.groupBy() is:

Object.groupBy() groups elements into a JavaScript object.

Map.groupBy() groups elements into a Map object.

JavaScript String isWellFormed()
The isWellFormed() method returns true if a string is well formed.

Otherwise it returns false.

A string is not well formed if it contains lone surrogates.

Examples
let text = "Hello world!";
let result = text.isWellFormed();
let text = "Hello World \uD800";
let result = text.isWellFormed();
Lone Surrogates
A lone surrogate is a Unicode surrogate code point that is not part of a valid surrogate pair used to represent characters in UTF-16 encoding.

JavaScript String toWellFormed()
The String method toWellFormed() returns a new string where all "lone surrogates" are replaced with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).

Examples
let text = "Hello World \uD800";
let result = text.toWellFormed();

The RegExp.escape() Method
The RegExp.escape() method returns a string where characters that belongs to the regular expression syntax are escaped.

This makes it possible to treat characters like +, *, ?, ^, $, (, ), [, ], {, }, |, and \ literally, and not as part of a regular expression.

Example
Create a regular expression that matches the string "[*]":

// Escape a text for to use as a regular expression
const safe = RegExp.escape("[*]";

// Build a new reglar expression
const regex = new RegExp(safe);

// Text to replace within
const oldText = "[*] is a web school.";

// Perform the replace
const newText = oldText.match(regex, "W3Schools");

The Float16Array Method
A Float16Array is a TypedArray that stores 16-bit (half-precision) floating-point numbers in the IEEE 754 half-precision format.

Float16Array requires half the memory of Float32Array and a quarter of Float64Array.

Example
const myArr = new Float16Array([1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]);

let bytes = myArr.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT;
let length = myArr.length;
The Float16Array object is supported in all modern browsers since June 2024:

The Promise.try() Method
The Promise.try() method starts a promise chain from potentially throwing, synchronous code.

This ensures exceptions are correctly handled as promise rejections.

Example
function compute() {
  return Promise.try(() => {
    const v = mayThrowSync();
    return asyncFunc(v);
  });
}
JavaScript Set union()
The union() method returns the union of two sets.

The union() method returns a new set containing the elements which are in this set, or in the argument set, or in both:
