JavaScript Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Often this is the case when working with arrays:

Instead of writing:
text += cars[0] + "<br>";
text += cars[1] + "<br>";
text += cars[2] + "<br>";
text += cars[3] + "<br>";
text += cars[4] + "<br>";
text += cars[5] + "<br>";
You can write:
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
