Node Relationships
The nodes in the node tree have a hierarchical relationship to each other.

The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships.

In a node tree, the top node is called the root (or root node)
Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent)
A node can have a number of children
Siblings (brothers or sisters) are nodes with the same parent
