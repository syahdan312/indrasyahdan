JavaScript Coding Conventions
Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming. They typically cover:

Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.
Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.
Programming practices and principles.
Coding conventions secure quality:

Improve code readability
Make code maintenance easier
Coding conventions can be documented rules for teams to follow, or just be your individual coding practice.

This page describes the general JavaScript code conventions used by W3Schools.
You should also read the next chapter "Best Practices", and learn how to avoid coding pitfalls.

Variable Names
At W3schools we use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).

All names start with a letter.

At the bottom of this page, you will find a wider discussion about naming rules.

firstName = "John";
lastName = "Doe";

price = 19.90;
tax = 0.20;

fullPrice = price + (price * tax);
Spaces Around Operators
Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas:

Examples:
let x = y + z;
const myArray = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];
