Back-Tics Syntax
Template Strings use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:

Example
let text = `Hello World!`;

Quotes Inside Strings
Template Strings allow both single and double quotes inside a string:

Example
let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;

Multiline Strings
Template Strings allow multiline strings:

Example
let text =
`The quick
brown fox
jumps over
the lazy dog`;
