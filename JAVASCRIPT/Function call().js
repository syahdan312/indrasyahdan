All Functions are Methods
In JavaScript all functions are object methods.

If a function is not a method of a JavaScript object, it is a function of the global object (see previous chapter).

The example below creates an object with 3 properties, firstName, lastName, fullName.

Example
const person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

// This will return "John Doe":
person.fullName();
