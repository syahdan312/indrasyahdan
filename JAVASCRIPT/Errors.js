Errors Will Happen!
When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur.

Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things.

Example
In this example we misspelled "alert" as "adddlert" to deliberately produce an error:

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
try {
  adddlert("Welcome guest!");
}
catch(err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err.message;
}
</script>
