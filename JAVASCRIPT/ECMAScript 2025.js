The RegExp.escape() Method
The RegExp.escape() method returns a string where characters that belongs to the regular expression syntax are escaped.

This makes it possible to treat characters like +, *, ?, ^, $, (, ), [, ], {, }, |, and \ literally, and not as part of a regular expression.

Example
Create a regular expression that matches the string "[*]":

// Escape a text for to use as a regular expression
const safe = RegExp.escape("[*]";

// Build a new reglar expression
const regex = new RegExp(safe);

// Text to replace within
const oldText = "[*] is a web school.";

// Perform the replace
const newText = oldText.match(regex, "W3Schools");
RegExp.escape() is supported all in modern browsers since May 2025:

Modules with Import Attributes
Syntax
import {names} from "module-name" with {key:"data"};

The Float16Array Method
A Float16Array is a TypedArray that stores 16-bit (half-precision) floating-point numbers in the IEEE 754 half-precision format.

Float16Array requires half the memory of Float32Array and a quarter of Float64Array.

Example
const myArr = new Float16Array([1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]);

let bytes = myArr.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT;
let length = myArr.length;
The Float16Array object is supported in all modern browsers since June 2024:

The Math.f16round Method
The static Math.f16round() method returns the nearest 16-bit floating point representation of a number.

Example
let a = Math.f16round(2.60);
let b = Math.f16round(2.50);
let c = Math.f16round(2.49);
let d = Math.f16round(-2.60);
let e = Math.f16round(-2.50);
let f = Math.f16round(-2.49);

The Promise.try() Method
The Promise.try() method starts a promise chain from potentially throwing, synchronous code.

This ensures exceptions are correctly handled as promise rejections.

Example
function compute() {
  return Promise.try(() => {
    const v = mayThrowSync();
    return asyncFunc(v);
  });
}
JavaScript Set union()
The union() method returns the union of two sets.

The union() method returns a new set containing the elements which are in this set, or in the argument set, or in both:

Union

Example
const A = new Set(['a','b','c']);
const B = new Set(['b','c','d']);

const C = A.union(B);
The union() method is supported in all modern browsers since June 2024:

JavaScript Set intersection()
The intersection() method returns the intersection of two sets.

The intersection() method returns a new set containing the elements which are in this set and in the argument set:

Intersection

Example
const A = new Set(['a','b','c']);
const B = new Set(['b','c','d']);

const C = A.intersection(B);
The intersection() method is supported in all modern browsers since June 2024:

JavaScript Set difference()
The difference() method returns the difference between two sets.

The difference() method returns a new set containing elements which are in this set but not in the argument set:

Difference

Example
const A = new Set(['a','b','c']);
const B = new Set(['b','c','d']);

const C = A.difference(B);

JavaScript Set symmetricDifference()
The symmetricDifference() method returns the symmetric difference between to sets.

The symmetricDifference() method returns a new set containing elements which are in this set or in the argument set, but not in both:

Symmetric Difference

Example
const A = new Set(['a','b','c']);
const B = new Set(['b','c','d']);

const C = A.symetricDifference(B);
The symmetricDifference() method is supported in all modern browsers since June 2024:
