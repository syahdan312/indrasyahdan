Function Sequence
JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in the sequence they are defined.

This example will end up displaying "Goodbye":

Example
function myFirst() {
  myDisplayer("Hello");
}

function mySecond() {
  myDisplayer("Goodbye");
}

myFirst();
mySecond();
