Exponentiation Operator
The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

Example
let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2;
x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x, y):

Example
let x = 5;
let z = Math.pow(x,2);
Exponentiation Assignment
The exponentiation assignment operator (**=) raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.
Example
let x = 5;
x **= 2;

JavaScript Array includes()
ECMAScript 2016 introduced Array.includes to arrays.

This allows us to check if an element is present in an array:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

fruits.includes("Mango");
