The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Example
In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10:

Example
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
