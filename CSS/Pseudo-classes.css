/* What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus
Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements
Mouse Over Me
Click Me To Get Focus
