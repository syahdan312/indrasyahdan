/* CSS background-image
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

Example
Set the background image for a page:  */

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

body {
  background-image: url("bgdesert.jpg");
}
