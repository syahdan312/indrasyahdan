/* CSS Combinators
A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
There are four different combinators in CSS:
Descendant combinator (space)
Child combinator (>)
Next sibling combinator (+)
Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)
Descendant Combinator
The descendant combinator matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 
Example */
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
