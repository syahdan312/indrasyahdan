/* Grid Container
A grid container contains one or more grid items arranged in columns and rows.

Direct child elements(s) of the grid container automatically becomes grid items.

An element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.

Grid Tracks
The rows and columns of a grid is defined with the grid-template-rows and the grid-template-columns properties (or the shorthand grid or grid-template properties).

These define the grid tracks. A grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines.

The grid-template-columns Property
The grid-template-columns property defines the number of columns in your grid layout, and it can define the width of each column.

The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the width of the respective column.

If you want your grid layout to contain 4 columns, specify the width of the 4 columns, or "auto" if all columns should have the same width.

Example
Make a grid with 4 columns of equal width: */
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto;
}
