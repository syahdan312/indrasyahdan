/* CSS Grid Layout
The Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns.

The Grid Layout Module allows developers to easily create complex web layouts.

The Grid Layout Module makes it easier to design a responsive layout structure, without using float or positioning.

The CSS grid properties are supported in all modern browsers.

Grid vs. Flexbox
The CSS Grid Layout should be used for two-dimensional layout, with rows AND columns.

The CSS Flexbox Layout should be used for one-dimensional layout, with rows OR columns.

CSS Grid Components
A grid always consists of:

a Grid Container - the parent (container) <div> element
Grid Items - the items inside the container <div>
Grid Container and Grid Items
A grid layout consists of a parent element (the grid container), with one or more grid items.

All direct children of the grid container automatically become grid items.
