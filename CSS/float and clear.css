/* The float Property
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.
The float property can have one of the following values:
left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.
Example - float: right;
The following example specifies that an image should float to the right in a text:
PineappleLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa.
Example */
img {
  float: right;
}
/* The clear Property
When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.
The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
The clear property can have one of the following values:
none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent
When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.
Example
This example clears the float to the left. Here, it means that the <div2> element is pushed below the left floated <div1> element:  */
div1 {
  float: left;
}

div2 {
  clear: left;
}
/* The clearfix Hack
If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem:
Without Clearfix
With Clearfix
Example
.clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}
The overflow: auto clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and padding (else you might see scrollbars). The new, modern clearfix hack however, is safer to use, and the following code is used for most webpages:
Example */
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

/* Grid of Boxes / Equal Width Boxes
Box 1
Box 2
Box 1
Box 2
Box 3
With the float property, it is easy to float boxes of content side by side:
Example */
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.box {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%; /* three boxes (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */
  padding: 50px; /* if you want space between the images */
}
