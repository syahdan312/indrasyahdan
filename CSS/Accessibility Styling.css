/* CSS Accessibility Styling
Good CSS styling should help all users interact with your website, including those with visual or mobility challenges.
1. Use Visible Focus Indicators
The CSS :focus pseudo-class is used to select and style the element that gets focus.
Always use the :focus state so that keyboard and screen reader users can see which element is active.
Example */
a:focus,
button:focus,
input:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
