The <object> Element
The <object> element is supported by all browsers.
The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.
It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:
Example
<object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
Or images if you like:
Example
<object data="audi.jpeg"></object>
