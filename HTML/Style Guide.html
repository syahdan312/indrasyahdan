Use Lowercase Element Names
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to type
Good:
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
Bad:
<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph.</P>
</BODY>
