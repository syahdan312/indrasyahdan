Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
To play your video on a web page, do the following:

Upload the video to YouTube
Take a note of the video id
Define an <iframe> element in your web page
Let the src attribute point to the video URL
Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
Example
<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
</iframe>

YouTube Autoplay + Mute
You can let your video start playing automatically when a user visits the page, by adding autoplay=1 to the YouTube URL. However, automatically starting a video is annoying for your visitors!
Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.
Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).
